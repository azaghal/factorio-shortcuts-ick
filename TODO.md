# TODO from morley376

* Stuff for GameViewSettings
* Custom screenshot (zoom level, resolution, etc. customizable)
* Autosave button for singleplayer worlds
* Combat drone full deploy? (Uses as many drone capsules as required to fill the cap to max)
* Bloodbelt/lamp autowire builder toggle?
* Safety lock for weapons (prevent the ability to nuke/shotgun/flame your base) (unsure if this is moddable)
* Polar grid
* Clock/time played statistics (see player.online_time and game.tick)
