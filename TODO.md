### DUCUMENTATION
* new thumbnail and description
* picture on GitHub
* Make table with overview of all shortcuts
*

### GENERAL
* Option to categorise all shortcuts (new labels "Spidertron", "GUI")
* Option to add control info to all shortcuts
* Option for spidertron remote shortcut to generate an already assigned remote. (nearest spidertron or the spidertron the player is riding)
*

### COMPATIBILITY
*

### BUGS:
* Make chest merge tool from Merging Chests mod available dependant on research.
*

### NEW SHORTCUTS:
* Proper integration of PickerInventoryTools
*

### LOCALE
*

### GRAPHICS
* car finder disabled icons
* marc_calc_4func disabled icons from MaxRateCalculator
*

### KNOWN ISSUES:
* Disabled artillery and equipment is lost when settings change or the mod is removed. Make sure to enable all artillery and equipment before you uninstall this mod or change related settings.
* Custom input references in shortcut names only update when a map is loaded.
* The spidertron and train setting shortcuts don't update immediately if you tick the checkboxes in the GUIs. Close the GUI and the shortcut will be in the correct state.
* [Disabled equipment turns on when using jetpack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Shortcuts-ick/discussion/5fde6b8e5658c168553b8220)
* The order of shortcuts will change if the mod was temporarily disabled.
*

### IMPOSSIBLE REQUESTS
* [Toolbar count switch](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Shortcuts-ick/discussion/5f6fa911bbbb9ad3f31bb719)
* [Lock belt building to straight line](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Shortcuts-ick/discussion/5fd2fb88bc7a3c4cb79a737e)
*

### TODO from morley376
* Stuff for GameViewSettings
* Custom screenshot (zoom level, resolution, etc. customizable) (ALREADY EXISTS)
* Autosave button for singleplayer worlds
* Combat drone full deploy? (Uses as many drone capsules as required to fill the cap to max)
* Bloodbelt/lamp autowire builder toggle? (OUTDATED)
* Safety lock for weapons (prevent the ability to nuke/shotgun/flame your base) (unsure if this is moddable)
* Polar grid
* Clock/time played statistics (see player.online_time and game.tick)
*
